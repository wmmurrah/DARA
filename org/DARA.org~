**** AGENDA
     1. Chelsea - discuss/provide updates on the WINGS SPSS analytic data set.
         First, a nearly-full analytic dataset has been generated along with a codebook (html doc, but maybe eventually be a fancier pdf). Second, I have a solid plan for fixing the date variables, the "nearly-full" data-set will be qualified for only a short period of time.  Finally, the codebook isn't working as smoothly as I'd like, so I'd like to get some feedback from our 'consumers' (e.g., Laura) about what is an absolute "must-have."
     2. Pam - I started sorting through the WINGS Leader questionnaires & assessments and there are a lot of mixed cohort Nests, although our databases at the moment are divided by cohort. I am wondering about the least confusing way to enter those?
     3.  Helyn what has all been munged together and what still needs to be done--in thinking about my dissertation proposal, I'm just trying to gauge what data is available currently.
     4. Hank - Do we need meet every week?
**** DISCUSSED:
     1. Chelsea - master data set created. Code book also, she will send around.
     2. Beth will check on data structure and get back to Pam.
     3. Helyn - Justin and Chelsea will prioritize cohort 3 for Helyn.
     4. Claire asked about WINGS papers, she wants to plan her semester.

**** AGENDA:
     1. Pam -  have a question about Summer 2015 child assessments, most of which actually occurred in Spring 2015
     2. Helyn - can we talk about what our role is for fidelity data?
     3. How is the complete data set? Where is it, and who has access?
     4. Will start learning Multiple Imputation soon.

**** DISCUSSED:
     1. Summer2015post-test timing issue for C1 and C2. Testers observe that this make have impacted validity of testing. Children remember test.
     2. Not going to do anything with fidelity data at this point.
     3. Complete data. Get Justin access to castldrive. Sent Hall data today.
*** 2015.09.25
**** AGENDA:
     1. Beth questions.
     2.  revisit data management for fidelity data (Helyn)
     3. inCLASS and CLASS data, specifically--how to get Justin access to the data and get him to meet with Michelle about cleaning it. (Helyn)
     4. Dave

**** DISCUSSED:
     1. Beth: questions about IES annual report for WINGS
     2. Helyn: Fidelity data. All raw data should eventually be back at UVA.
     3. Helyn: inCLASS CLASS data. Need Clair to teach us how to get from Blackhawk.
     4. Dave: Need to think about multiple comparisons issues. data reduction strategies etc. 

*** 2015.10.12
**** Old Business:
     1. Beth: questions about IES annual report for WINGS
     2. Helyn: Fidelity data. All raw data should eventually be back at UVA.
     3. Helyn: inCLASS CLASS data. Need Clair to teach us how to get from Blackhawk.
     4. Dave: Need to think about multiple comparisons issues. data reduction strategies etc.
**** AGENDA:
     1. Blackhawk - Claire
     2. paper ideas
     3. schedule a report walk through for next DARA meeting
     4. Chelsea will work on R to SPSS issue.

**** NEW BUSINESS:
     1. Blackhawk - Claire thinks we should be able to use existing documentation to import CLASS inCLASS.
          found at : FOCAL LAB -> WINGS -> Measures -> Child Measures -> Behavioral Observation and on CASTL drive.
          Claire and Helyn will work to get that together (NOPE - Helyn found the data). 
           (need a person to take over torch for Blackhawk, Claire will email me contact).

     2. create process for paper writing process. 
          - step 1. come up with list of stuff being done.
              create excel sheet of ongoing projects.
              What is time frame for final data collection? Summer bled into fall for final data collection
          - step 2. People should be thinking about interests in paper they want to lead.
	Hank will contact Dave to get this on Nov 4th. agenda
