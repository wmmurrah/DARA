TITLE:           Level 2 missing covariate (p.405); !the default is to model 
                 !under missing data theory using all available data.
DATA:            FILE IS C:\Mplus\ch10miss2.dat;
                 Format is 5f8.0,4f8.2;
                              
VARIABLE:        Names are schcode female lowses read math CSES

                 MISSING are CSES(-999);
                 !The MISSING option is used to identify the values that 
                 !will be treated as missing or invalid in the analysis.

ANALYSIS:        Type = twolevel;

Model:
